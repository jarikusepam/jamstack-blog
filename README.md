## Demo https://nifty-davinci-1be32e.netlify.app/

It is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

There is a [series of articles](https://devx.sh/blog/blog-with-next-js-react-material-ui-and-typescript) on my blog describing how this project works under the hood, so if you are interested, have a look there.

## Executing this project

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
